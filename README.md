# Welcome to my Recipe App!
This an updated version of the Trybe project called 'Recipe App'. 
Initially, this was a project made in colab with my Trybe colleagues as a final step in the front-end module.

I've made some changes in the layout and was able to refactor the project to add some new functions (eg. Offcanvas in the header and some new redesigned recipe cards)

### More info
This app was created using the React framework alongside with some libraries that was usefull, including:
- Bootstrap
- Redux-Toolkit
- use-local-storage-state
- immerjs
- lodash
